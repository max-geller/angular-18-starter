# Contributor Code of Conduct

We want to create a positive and welcoming environment for everyone. As contributors and maintainers of this project, we are committed to ensuring that participation in our project and community is harassment-free, regardless of age, ethnicity, gender, experience level, education, nationality, race, or religion.

## Our Standards

These are some examples of behaviors that help make our project a positive space:

- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences
- Being open to constructive feedback
- Keeping the project’s best interests in mind
- Showing respect and empathy to fellow contributors

And here are some things that we won't tolerate:

- Using sexualized language or making unwelcome sexual advances
- Trolling, insulting, or making personal attacks
- Sharing private information, such as someone’s address, without their permission
- Any behavior that could be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for setting and enforcing these standards. They’ll take fair and appropriate action when necessary if someone violates the Code of Conduct.

Maintainers have the authority to remove, edit, or reject contributions (comments, commits, code, etc.) that don’t follow these guidelines. They can also ban contributors temporarily or permanently if needed.

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness any abusive or unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project lead. We’ll review and investigate all complaints, and respond in a way that fits the situation. We’ll also make sure to keep the reporter’s information confidential.

If a project maintainer doesn't enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith, they may face temporary or permanent consequences as decided by other leaders in the project.
